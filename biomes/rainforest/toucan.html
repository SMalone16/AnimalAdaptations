          <h2>Beaks built for balance</h2>
          <p>
            Toucans hop through the canopy eating fruit and insects. Their bright beaks help them grab snacks that other birds cannot reach.

          <h3>Lightweight Beak</h3>
          <p>
            A toucan's huge beak is mostly hollow, so it is light and easy to wave around while plucking fruit.

          <p>
            Toucans toss fruit into the air and catch it. This keeps the food clean and lets them eat without using their short tongues.
