          <h2>Life upside down</h2>
          <p>
            Sloths spend most of their lives hanging from branches. Moving slowly helps them stay hidden high in the rainforest.

          <h3>Slow Motion Camouflage</h3>
          <p>
            By moving very slowly, sloths look like part of the tree. Green algae grows in their fur and makes them blend in even more.

          <p>
            Sloths eat leaves that do not give much energy. A slow heartbeat and cool body help them save energy all day long.
