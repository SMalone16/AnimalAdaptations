            Amazon river dolphins, also called botos, swim through flooded forests. Their flexible bodies help them turn around trees.

          <h3>Bendy Neck</h3>
          <p>
            Extra neck bones let the dolphin move its head side to side to peek around roots and logs.

          <p>
            As they get older, dolphins turn pink, which helps them blend with the red-brown river water during the day.
